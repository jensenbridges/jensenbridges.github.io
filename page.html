        <h1>Teaching Experience</h1>
        <p>I have been employed by Oklahoma State University since the fall of 2022 as a learning assistant for college algebra and math functions. In this position, I attend the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday classes for a five-day corequisite class and teach the Tuesday and Thursday sections. I lead class independently, plan lessons, create assignments, proctor tests, and grade papers. I also coordinate and communicate with students outside of the classroom for further assistance.</p>
		<p>I also worked at Mathocity in Stillwater, Oklahoma, from August of 2022 until January of 2024 as a mathematics tutor and ACT Prep course leader. I worked one-on-one with students on anything from third grade to introductory college level mathematics. I created lesson plans and assigned homework, as many of our students were Epic students or homeschooled. I also led group sessions for classes such as 6th grade math or high school geometry.
		<p>From January to March of 2022, I participated as a tutor in the Oklahoma State Department of Education's inaugural Oklahoma Math Tutoring Corps where I was paired with three students to meet with virtually three times a week for about nine weeks. I created and implemented lesson plans based on the Oklahoma learning standards for eighth graders. I focused on acceleration rather than remediation - teaching concepts the students will later learn in their school classrooms and going over the remedial skills needed only for that concept.
